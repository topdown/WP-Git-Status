WordPress Git Status
=============================

It requires PHP 5+, shell_exec permissions also required and is OOP style.
---------------------------------------

Pretty straight forward, shows git status (Lets you know if any files have changed so you know if you should investigate or login and push).

This is a very simple plugin but is worthy of use if you use git to manage your WordPress site.

Also includes a quick link in the Admin Bar.
